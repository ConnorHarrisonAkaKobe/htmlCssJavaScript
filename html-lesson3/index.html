    <h1>Welcome to My Website</h1>
    <p>My name is Connor, I go to MCCC to be a Software Engineer. I like to play Basketball as a hobby, but sometimes I don't because I get busy and tired. I have 2 pets, a dog named Breezy and a cat named Missy. I am currently trying to advance at HTML and Javascript.</p>
    <br>
    <p>I use to bench 160, but It's been hard to get back into working out as a everyday schedule, so I can kind of bench 155. My favorite subject is Math, because it is the most easy. I have ADD, so I can barely focus on anything. </p>
